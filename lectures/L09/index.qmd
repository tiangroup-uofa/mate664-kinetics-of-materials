## Learning Outcomes {.center}

After this lecture, you will be able to:

- Recall the conditions behind the Einstein diffusion equation
- Understand why the Einstein relation is universal across states of matter
- Connect gas, liquid, and solid diffusion within a unified framework
- Derive Arrhenius-type diffusivity from a 1D potential well model
- Identify assumptions and missing physics in simple diffusion models

## Recap: Linking Atomistic Motion to Diffusion {.center}

From last lecture:

- Diffusion emerges from random microscopic motion
- Mean squared displacement (MSD) is the key observable
- Einstein equation links MSD to macroscopic diffusivity


## Einstein Diffusion Equation

Define MSD as the normalized second moment of concentration:

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\langle R^2(t)\rangle
&=
\frac{\int_0^\infty r^2 c(r,t)\,4\pi r^2 dr}
{\int_0^\infty c(r,t)\,4\pi r^2 dr}
\end{align}
```

Using solution to point source diffusion, Einstein showed:

- 3D: $\langle R^2\rangle = 6Dt$
- 2D: $\langle R^2\rangle = 4Dt$
- 1D: $\langle R^2\rangle = 2Dt$

## Random-Walk Model Solution to MSD

MSD in a 1D random-walk model is the expectance value of $\text{Distance}^2$:

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\langle R^2(t)\rangle
&= N_{\tau} \langle r^2\rangle \\
&= \Gamma \tau \langle r^2\rangle
\end{align}
```

## Linking Einstein Equation To Random Walk Model

- Two methods should give the same result for $\langle R^2(t)\rangle$
- $t$ in Einstein's method is just $\tau$ in random walk model

Compare (1D case):

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\langle R^2(\tau)\rangle
&= 2 D \tau \\
&= \Gamma \tau \langle r^2\rangle
\end{align}
```

Results for diffusivity $D$

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
D &= \frac{\Gamma \langle r^2\rangle}{6};\quad \text{3D} \\
&= \frac{\Gamma \langle r^2\rangle}{4};\quad \text{2D}\\
&= \frac{\Gamma \langle r^2\rangle}{2};\quad \text{1D}
\end{align}
```

## In-Depth Analysis of Microscopic $D$ Formula

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
D &= \frac{\Gamma \langle r^2\rangle}{6};\quad \text{3D} \\
&= \frac{\Gamma \langle r^2\rangle}{4};\quad \text{2D}\\
&= \frac{\Gamma \langle r^2\rangle}{2};\quad \text{1D}
\end{align}
```

Units:

- Diffusivity $D$: $\text{m}^2/\text{s}$
- Mean jump length $\langle r^2\rangle$: $\text{m}$
- Frequency $\Gamma$: $\text{s}^{-1}$
- The macroscopic diffusivity is directly linked to microscopic movements!

## Correction For Correlated Jumps

The random-walk model considers "uncorrelated" jumps, where subsequent
events are independent of previous steps, where $\langle R^2\rangle = N_{\tau} \langle r^2\rangle$.

In reality, some atomic motions are "correlated", so that the direction / probability of the next move are linked to previous events. Examples include:

- Movement in tangled polymer chains
- Vacancy-mediated diffusion in solids
- Push-out mechanism of interstalcy diffusion

3D Diffusivity correction:

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
D &= \frac{\Gamma \langle r^2\rangle}{6} f \\
f &\leq 1\;\quad\text{for correlated-jump}
\end{align}
```

## Application of Microscopic Diffusivity Equation

The master equation for microscopic diffusivity becomes

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\boxed{
D = \frac{\Gamma \langle r^2\rangle}{6} f
}
\end{align}
```

Applicable fields?

- Gas? ✅ -- kinetic theory of gases
- Liquid? ✅ -- Stokes-Einstein equation
- Amorphous material / polymers? ✅ -- Modified Stokes-Einstein
- Solid? ✅ -- various mechanism

## Case 1: Gas-Phase Diffusivity

$\Gamma$ and $r^2$ in gas phase can be solved using statistical
mechanics treatment (kinetic theory). Some important results:

- Average velocity $\langle u \rangle$ ($m$: molecular weight)

$$
\langle u \rangle = \sqrt{\frac{8 k_B T}{\pi m}}
$$

- Mean free path $\lambda$ ($n$: number density; $d$: molecular diameter)

$$
\lambda = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \pi d n}
$$

- Relation to microscopic parameters:

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\Gamma &= \frac{\langle u \rangle}{\lambda} \\
\langle r^2 \rangle &= 2 \lambda^2 \\
D &= \frac{1}{3} \langle u \rangle \lambda
\end{align}
```

## Gas-Phase Diffusivity: $T, p$ relations

Using ideal gas law $p = n k_B T$, it is possible to show

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
D &\propto \sqrt{T} (\frac{p}{k_B T})^{-1} \\
&= \frac{T^{3/2}}{p}
\end{align}
```

Methods like the Chapman-Enskog theory has such power laws with $T$
and $p$, and can predict $D$ in gas phase within 10% error compared to
experimental results.

## Case 2: Liquid-Phase Diffusivity

Recall the macroscopic model for diffusivity (Einstein relation) that links mobility $M$ to diffusivity $D$ using steady-state motion of a particle in a frictous fluid:

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
D &= M k_B T \\
M &= \frac{\text{[velocity]}}{\text{[driving force]}}
\end{align}
```

At steady-state, the driving force $F_{d}$ equals the opposite of
dragging force $f_{drag}$. In the linear regime, we can often model
$f_{drag} = k_{f} v$, where $k_{f}$ is the friction factor.

We will see the mobility treatment is essentially the same as $D \propto \Gamma \langle r^2 \rangle$.

## Newton's Equation For Transport In Frictuous Liquid

- Goal: from dynamic equation of the system --> expressions for $\Gamma$ and $\langle r^2 \rangle$

- Governing Equation

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
m a &= F_{d} - k_f v \\
m \frac{\partial^2 x}{\partial t^2} &= F_{d} - k_f \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} \\
\vdots & \vdots \\
\frac{m}{2} \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left[
\frac{\partial (x^2)}{\partial t}
\right] - m \left(
\frac{\partial x}{\partial t}
\right)^2
&= x F_{d,x} - \frac{k_f}{2} \frac{\partial (x^2)}{\partial t}
\end{align}
```

## Transport In Frictuous Liquid: Results

We're more interested in the average displacement $x^2$. In 1D system it follows:

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\langle \frac{\partial (x^2)}{\partial t} \rangle
&= \frac{2 k_B T}{k_f} \\
\langle x^2 \rangle &= \frac{2 k_B T}{k_f} t
\end{align}
```

Which means $\langle x^2 \rangle$ linearly increases with time!

## Linking Diffusivity Results

For 3D
system where $x, y, z$ motions are independent, $\langle R^2 \rangle =
\langle x^2 \rangle + \langle y^2 \rangle + \langle z^2 \rangle =
\frac{6 k_B T}{k_f} t$. We can reuse the result $\langle R^2 \rangle =
6 Dt$:

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
D &= \frac{\langle R^2 \rangle}{6 t} \\
  &= \frac{\cancel{6} k_B T \cancel{t}}{k_f \cancel{6} \cancel{t}} \\
  &= \frac{k_B T}{k_f} \\
  &= M k_B T
\end{align}
```

We've arrived at the macroscopic conclusion! The last expression uses the relation $M = f_k^{-1}$.

## Diffusivity in Liquid: Stokes-Einstein Equation

When the mobility $M$ uses the Stokes equation $f_{drag} = 6 \pi \eta R v$, we arrive at the Stokes-Einstein equation:

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
D &= M k_B T\\
  &= \frac{\cancel{v}}{6 \pi \eta R \cancel{v}} k_B T \\
  &= \frac{k_B T}{6 \pi \eta R}
\end{align}
```

- Viscosity $\eta$ (unit $\text{Pa}\cdot \text{s}$) typically follows thermal activation $\eta \propto \exp(A/T)$
- What about the radius $R$ for _non-spherical_ objects?

## Polymer Diffusivity Models

In linear polymer with $N$ repeating units, each having characteristic
lenth $b$, the self-diffusivity follows:

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
D^*  &= \frac{k_B T}{6 \pi \eta R_h}
\end{align}
```

and the hydrodynamic radius $R_h$ scales as

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
R_h &\sim
\begin{cases}
N^{3/5} b & \text{good solvent} \\
N^{1/2} b & \theta \text{theta solvent}
\end{cases}
\end{align}
```

- Good solvent: polymer–solvent interaction is favorable 
- Theta solvent: polymer–solvent interaction is neutral (like ideal chain)

## Case 3: Diffusivity in Solids

The relation $D = \frac{\Gamma r^2}{6} f$ can be applied to diffusion in solids, if we know the type of _mechanism_

Some terminologies:

- *Mechanism*: an abstraction of atomic motion in crystals
- *Sites*: available spaces for atoms to move in / out
  - Substitutional site: an atom replaces the position of another
  - Interstitial site: an atom is inserted into the spaces between two atomic sites
- *Barrier*: when moving atoms in either substitional or interstitial mechanisms, the inter-atomic potential causes moving atoms to "feel" higher energy states

Key of diffusion theory: barrier ⇔ diffusivity

## Solid Diffusion: Potential Well Model

The easiest model to illustrate the effect of an energy barrier is the
potential well model. Our goal is still to find:

1) Expression for $\Gamma$, $r^2$ (and optionally $f$)
2) Derive $D = \frac{\Gamma r^2}{6} f$

## Potential Well Model

Key results:

- Attempted frequency $\nu$ (due to kinetic energy)

$$
\nu = \sqrt{\frac{k_B T}{2 \pi m}} \frac{1}{L_w}
$$

- Cross-barrier frequency $\Gamma'$

$$
\Gamma' = \nu e^{-\frac{E^a}{k_B T}}
$$

- Diffusivity

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
D &= \sqrt{\frac{k_B T}{2 \pi m}} \frac{(L_w + L_a)^2}{L_w} e^{-\frac{E^a}{k_B T}} \\
  &= D_0 e^{-\frac{E^a}{k_B T}}
\end{align}
```
