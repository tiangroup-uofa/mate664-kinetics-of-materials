## Recap: Fick's Laws of Diffusion

- 1st law: steady-state diffusion

$$
  \vec{J}_i = -D_i \nabla c_i
$$

- 2nd law: time-dependent diffusion

$$
  \frac{\partial c}{\partial t} = D_i \nabla^2 c_i
$$

## Recap: Different definitions of diffusivities

![Lattice (C) vs Lab (V) frame](./public/c-l-frame-nthu.png){width="55%"}

- Self-diffusivity $D^*$
- Intrinsic diffusivity $D_i$ (lattice frame / C-frame; $\mathtt{C}$ 👉crystal)
- Inter-diffusivity $\tilde{D}$ (laboratory frame / V-frame; $\mathtt{V}$ 👉volume-fixed)

We will see a few examples today for more clarification.

- Lattice constraint:
  $$
  c_i + c_i^* + c_v = \text{const}
  $$

  - General "network-constrained" problem
- Vacancy concentration often at equilibrium
  - Vacancy balance with the source (surface / grain boundary / dislocation)

## Flux Relations in Network-Constrained Systems

- Flux driven by chemical potential differences (1D)
  - Non-radioactive species:
  $$
	J_i = -L_{ii}\frac{\partial (\mu_i - \mu_v)}{\partial x} -L_{i{i}^*}\frac{\partial (\mu_{i^*} - \mu_v)}{\partial x} 
  $$

  - Radioactive species:
  $$
	J_{i^*} = -L_{{i^*}{i}}\frac{\partial (\mu_{i} - \mu_v)}{\partial x}
	-L_{{i^*}{i^*}}\frac{\partial (\mu_{i^*} - \mu_v)}{\partial x}
  $$

  - Vacancy (zero-flux, why?):
  $$
  J_v = 0
  $$
  

## Vacancy Equilibrium Assumption

- $\mu_v = \text{const}$
- $J_v = 0$
- total flux balance:
  $$
  J_i + J_i^* + J_v = 0
  $$

---

## Resulting Self-Diffusion Flux

- Chemical potential gradient:
  $$
  \frac{\partial \mu_{i^*}}{\partial x}
  = k_B T \frac{1}{c_i}\frac{\partial c_i}{\partial x}
  $$
- Self-diffusion coefficient:
  $$
  D^{*} = k_B T\left(\frac{L_{ii}}{c_i} - \frac{L_{ii^*}}{c_{i^*}}\right)
  $$

## Self-diffusion summary

- **No** macroscopic concentration gradient!
- Chemical potential varies locally for $i$ and $i^*$
- Follows the Fick equation!

## Self-diffusion in binary solution: diffusivity

- We have self-diffusion for 4 species (1, 1$^*$, 2 and V)
- General flux balance still holds
- Vacancy concentration is uniform 
- Still follows Fick's law.

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
J_{1^*} &= -k_B T \left[ \frac{L_{11}}{c_1} - \frac{L_{11^*}}{c_{1^*}} \right] \frac{\partial c_{1^*}}{\partial x} \\
&= - D_1^* \frac{\partial c_{1^*}}{\partial x}
\end{align}
```

## Diffusion in Inhomogeneous Materials

- Real materials are rarely homogeneous
- Concentration gradients exist by construction
- Diffusion fluxes differ locally in space
- Leads to imbalance of material transport

---

## Historical Observation: Boyle (17th Century)

- Robert Boyle observed solid-state diffusion
- Zn penetration into Cu coin → brass formation
- Clear macroscopic evidence of diffusion in solids
- Mechanism not understood until 20th century


---

## Imbalance of Diffusion Fluxes

- Consider a binary diffusion couple A–B
- If $D_A \neq D_B$
- Then intrinsic fluxes differ:
  $$
  J_A^{C} \neq - J_B^{C}
  $$
- Mass transport is locally unbalanced

---

## Vacancy Mechanism and Imbalance

- Substitutional diffusion proceeds via vacancies
- Site conservation:
  $$
  J_A^{C} + J_B^{C} + J_v^{C} = 0
  $$
- Unequal atomic fluxes force a vacancy flux
- Vacancy flux is opposite to faster species

---

## Vacancy Accumulation Issue

- Vacancy flux implies transport of empty sites
- But vacancy concentration remains near equilibrium
- Fast sources/sinks (dislocations, GBs, surfaces)
- Therefore: no long-term vacancy buildup

---

## Kirkendall Effect

- Unequal intrinsic diffusivities
- Net vacancy flux in crystal frame
- Lattice planes shift to accommodate vacancy flow
- Inert markers move relative to sample ends

---

## C-frame View: Inhomogeneous Materials

- Crystal (C) frame attached to lattice sites
- Atomic fluxes are Fick-like:
  $$
  J_i^{C} = -D_i \frac{\partial C_i}{\partial x}
  $$
- Vacancy flux is kinematically constrained
- Lattice assumed locally intact

---

## Intrinsic Diffusivity

- Defined in the crystal frame
- Measures diffusion relative to lattice sites
- Denoted $D_i$
- Depends on:
  - jump frequency
  - vacancy availability
  - thermodynamic factor
  
```{=tex}
\begin{align*}
J_1^C &= -k_BT [\frac{L_{11}}{c_1} - \frac{L_{12}}{c_2}]\Phi \frac{\partial c}{\partial x} \\
&= -D_1 \frac{\partial c}{\partial x}
\end{align*}
```

---

## Relation to Self-Diffusivity

- Self-diffusion: tracer in homogeneous system
- No net chemical potential gradient
- Intrinsic diffusivity reduces to self-diffusivity:
  $$
  D_i = D_i^{*} \, \Phi
  $$
- $\Phi$: thermodynamic factor

---

## Thought Experiment: Vacancy Diffusion (C-frame)

- Assume $C_v \approx C_{v,\mathrm{eq}}$
- Yet $J_v^{C} \neq 0$
- Continuity cannot be satisfied by accumulation
- Requires an additional velocity

---

## Origin of Lattice Velocity

- Transform flux to lab frame:
  $$
  J_v^{\text{lab}} = J_v^{C} + C_v v
  $$
  
- Impose no net vacancy transport in lab frame:
  $$
  J_v^{\text{lab}} = 0
  $$
  
- Lattice velocity:
  $$
  v = -\frac{J_v^{C}}{C_v}
  $$

---

## Vacancy (V) Frame Basics

- V-frame moves with vacancy flux
- By definition:
  $$
  J_v^{V} = 0
  $$
- Atomic fluxes include convective term:
  $$
  J_i^{V} = J_i^{C} + C_i v
  $$

---

## Governing Equation in V-frame

- Impose volume conservation:
  $$
  J_1^{V}\Omega_1 + J_2^{V}\Omega_2 = 0
  $$
- Leads to single interdiffusion coefficient
- Darken equation emerges naturally

---

## Interdiffusivity

- Defined in volume-fixed (V) frame
- Flux form:
  $$
  J_i^{V} = -\tilde{D} \frac{\partial C_i}{\partial x}
  $$
- Interdiffusivity:
  $$
  \tilde{D} = D_1 X_2 + D_2 X_1
  $$

---

## Special Case: Interstitial Diffusion

- Interstitial atoms do not occupy lattice sites
- No site conservation constraint
- No lattice drift required
- Interdiffusivity reduces to:
  $$
  \tilde{D} \approx D_{\text{interstitial}}
  $$

---

## Summary: Types of Diffusivities

| Diffusivity | Frame | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| $D_i^{*}$ | lattice | tracer / self-diffusion |
| $D_i$ | C-frame | intrinsic diffusivity |
| $\tilde{D}$ | V-frame | interdiffusivity |



---

## Summary

- Inhomogeneity leads to flux imbalance
- Vacancy mechanism enforces site conservation
- Lattice velocity resolves vacancy continuity
- Choice of reference frame is essential
- Kirkendall effect is a frame-dependent phenomenon
