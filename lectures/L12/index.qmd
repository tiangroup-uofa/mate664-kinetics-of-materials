## Learning Outcomes {.center}

This is a recitation class. We will be reviewing what the Kinetics of Materials course
have currently covered.

After this lecture, you should be ablt to:

- Describe in your own words the major topics in kinetics course
- Link the irreversible thermodynamics to kinetics
- Understand the analog between diffusion and other kinetic problems
- Analysis of important charts in diffusion
- Apply irreversible and kinetic knowledge to modern material research
