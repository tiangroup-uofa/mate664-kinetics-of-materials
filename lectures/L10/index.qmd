## Recap of Lecture 07 {.center}
Key ideas from last lecture:

- Analytical solution to diffusion problems (infinite domain)
  - Semi-infinite (half-half) solution
  - Line / point source solution
  - Superimposition method
- Separation of variables method (finite / bounded domain)
- Laplace transform (will not be covered in exam)


## Learning Outcomes {.center}

After this lecture, you will be able to:

- Recall the conditions behind the Einstein diffusion equation
- Understand why the Einstein relation is universal across states of matter
- Connect gas, liquid, and solid diffusion within a unified framework
- Derive Arrhenius-type diffusivity from a 1D potential well model
- Identify assumptions and missing physics in simple diffusion models

## Recap: Linking Atomistic Motion to Diffusion {.center}

From last lecture:

- Diffusion emerges from random microscopic motion
- Mean squared displacement (MSD) is the key observable
- Einstein equation links MSD to macroscopic diffusivity

## Einstein Diffusion Equation

Define MSD as the normalized second moment of concentration:

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\langle R^2(t)\rangle
&=
\frac{\int_0^\infty r^2 c(r,t)\,4\pi r^2 dr}
{\int_0^\infty c(r,t)\,4\pi r^2 dr}
\end{align}
```

Using solution to point source diffusion, Einstein showed:
- 3D: $\langle R^2\rangle = 6Dt$
- 2D: $\langle R^2\rangle = 4Dt$
- 1D: $\langle R^2\rangle = 2Dt$
