## Course Information

- **Course Number**: MATE 664
- **Instructor**: Dr. Tian Tian
- **Semester**: Winter 2026
- **Office**: DICE 12-245
- **Office Hour**: by appointment

## Course Description

MAT E 664 is a graduate-level core course for Materials Engineering
students, and is also relevant to graduate students in Chemical
Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Chemistry, and related
disciplines interested in kinetic and transport phenomena in
materials. 

The course introduces the fundamental theory of
irreversible thermodynamics and key concepts from statistical
mechanics to explain driving forces and rates of non-equilibrium
processes. Emphasis is placed on both theoretical and numerical
approaches, with examples drawn from hard and soft materials
systems. 

By the end of the course, students will develop a unified
perspective on modeling processes such as phase transformations,
nucleation, diffusion, sintering, and aggregation.

### Additional references

Additional readings (papers, review articles, and supplementary notes) will be posted throughout the term (on our website and Canvas) as the course progresses.


## Lecture Notes

Thanks to recent developments in scientific typesetting and
interactive computing enabled by tools such as
[**Quarto**](https://quarto.org) and
[**Marimo**](https://docs.marimo.io), the course materials are
presented in different ways. You can view the course notes in the following ways:

- Directly browsing the webpage of individual lectures
- Open the slide presentations for lectures (powered by `reveal.js`)

In either way we have included interactive demonstrations of some
numerical solution to a few key problems, and we hope you enjoy
reading and interacting with the course materials!
